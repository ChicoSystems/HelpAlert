# HelpAlert
A prototype hackaton app to allow neighbors to help neighbors.

We present Help Alert, the community based support app. 
Especially in a time of crisis, we need to strengthen our community now more than ever. Help Alert is designed to allow neighbors to know how they can help others. A quest system with distances from your location appears allowing you to accept or pass over help requests if it is not someway you're interested in helping. Things can be as simple as helping someone open a particularly stuck jar to helping with lawn work that is physically out of someone's reach. On a karma based system, people can prove how good of neighbors they really are.
