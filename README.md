# HelpAlert
A prototype hackaton app to allow neighbors to help neighbors.

We present Help Alert, the community based support app. Especially in a time of crisis, we need to strengthen our community now more than ever. Help Alert is designed to allow neighbors to know how they can help others. A task based system where you can select tasks based on the distances from your location. Tasks will appears allowing you to accept or pass over help requests based on your interest. Tasks can be as simple as helping someone open a particularly stubborn jar to helping with lawn work. On a karma based system, people can prove how good of neighbors they really are.
