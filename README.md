We present Help Alert, the community-based help app. In our current crisis, we rely on our community now more than ever. Help Alert is designed for people in need of help to alert others willing to help them in close proximity. Our task-based system specifies the particular task that a person needs help with along with how far away that person is. For those who want to help, tasks will be defined so the helpers can find tasks that suit their interests. Tasks can be as simple as: helping someone open a stubborn jar of jam, helping with yard work, or even borrowing some cooking ingredients. Our system is karma based, so people can prove how good they are at helping their neighbors.
